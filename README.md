# Sensor Component Failure Prediction

## Problem Statement
- The system in focus is the Air Pressure system (APS) which generates pressurized air that are utilized in various functions in a truck, such as braking and gear changes. The datasets positive class corresponds to component failures for a specific component of the APS system. The negative class corresponds to trucks with failures for components not related to the APS system.

- The problem is to reduce the cost due to unnecessary repairs. So it is required to minimize the false predictions.

- Cost 1 = 10 and Cost 2 = 500

- The total cost of a prediction model the sum of Cost_1 multiplied by the number of Instances with type 1 failure and Cost_2 with the number of instances with type 2 failure, resulting in a Total_cost. In this case Cost_1 refers to the cost that an unnessecary check needs to be done by an mechanic at an workshop, while Cost_2 refer to the cost of missing a faulty truck, which may cause a breakdown.

- Total_cost = Cost_1 * No_Instances + Cost_2 * No_Instances.

- From the above problem statement we could observe that, we have to reduce false positives and false negatives. More importantly we have to **reduce false negatives, since cost incurred due to false negative is 50 times higher than the false positives.**

## Challenges and other objectives
- Need to Handle many Null values in almost all columns
- No low-latency requirement.
- Interpretability is not important.
- misclassification leads the unecessary repair costs.

## Tech Stack Used
- Python
- Scikit Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Numpy
- Pandas
- MongoDB
- Docker
- Airflow
- AWS

### Step 1 - Install the requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2 - Run main.py file

```bash
python main.py
```

Git commands

If you are starting a project and you want to use git in your project
```
git init
```
Note: This is going to initalize git in your source code.


OR

You can clone exiting github repo
```
git clone <github_url>
```
Note: Clone/ Downlaod github  repo in your system


Add your changes made in file to git stagging are
```
git add file_name
```
Note: You can given file_name to add specific file or use "." to add everything to staging are


Create commits
```
git commit -m "message"
```

```
git push origin main
```
Note: origin--> contains url to your github repo
main--> is your branch name 

To push your changes forcefully.
```
git push origin main -f
```


To pull  changes from github repo
```
git pull origin main
```
Note: origin--> contains url to your github repo
