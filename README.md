# Sensor Component Failure Prediction

## Problem Statement
The system in focus is the Air Pressure system (APS) which generates pressurized air that are utilized in various functions in a truck, such as braking and gear changes. The datasets positive class corresponds to component failures for a specific component of the APS system. The negative class corresponds to trucks with failures for components not related to the APS system.

The problem is to reduce the cost due to unnecessary repairs. So it is required to minimize the false predictions.

|True class | Positive | Negative | |
| ----------- | ----------- |   |  |
|<b>Predicted class</b>||| |
| Positive      |   -       | cost_1  |    |
| Negative   | cost_2        |  | |


Cost 1 = 10 and Cost 2 = 500

### Step 1 - Install the requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2 - Run main.py file

```bash
python main.py
```

Git commands

If you are starting a project and you want to use git in your project
```
git init
```
Note: This is going to initalize git in your source code.


OR

You can clone exiting github repo
```
git clone <github_url>
```
Note: Clone/ Downlaod github  repo in your system


Add your changes made in file to git stagging are
```
git add file_name
```
Note: You can given file_name to add specific file or use "." to add everything to staging are


Create commits
```
git commit -m "message"
```

```
git push origin main
```
Note: origin--> contains url to your github repo
main--> is your branch name 

To push your changes forcefully.
```
git push origin main -f
```


To pull  changes from github repo
```
git pull origin main
```
Note: origin--> contains url to your github repo
main--> is your branch name
